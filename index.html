          In 1991, Suzanne Collins began her professional career writing for
          children's television. She worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon
          shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit Clarissa Explains it All and
          The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo. For preschool viewers, she penned
          multiple stories for the Emmy-nominated Little Bear and Oswald. She
          also co-wrote the Rankin/Bass Christmas special, Santa, Baby! with her
          friend, Peter Bakalian, which was nominated for a WGA Award in
          Animation. Most recently she was the Head Writer for Scholastic
          Entertainment's Clifford's Puppy Days,and a freelancer on Wow! Wow!
          Wubbzy! While working on a Kids WB show called Generation O! she met
          children's author and illustrator James Proimos, who talked her into
          giving children's books a try.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how
          pastoral the setting must seem to kids who, like her own, lived in
          urban surroundings. In New York City, you're much more likely to fall
          down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you're not going to
          find a tea party. What you might find...? Well, that's the story of
          Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part fantasy/war
          series, The Underland Chronicles,which became a New York Times
          bestseller. It has been sold into 21 foreign territories.
          <br />
          <br />
          Her next series, The Hunger Games Trilogy, is an international
          bestseller. The Hunger Games has spent over six years to date on The
          New York Times bestseller list since publication in September 2008,
          and has also appeared consistently on USA Today and Publishers Weekly
          bestseller lists. It has been sold into 56 territories in 51
          languages. In 2010 Collins was named to the TIME 100 list as well as
          the Entertainment Weekly Entertainers of the Year list. Lionsgate
          released a film adaptation of THE HUNGER GAMES on March 23, 2012,
          directed by Gary Ross who also shared screenplay credit with Suzanne
          and Billy Ray. It broke multiple box office records and went on to
          become the 14th highest-grossing North American release of all time on
          its way to generating nearly $700 million at the worldwide box office.
          Lionsgate released the second installment THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING
          FIRE worldwide on November 22, 2013, directed by Francis Lawrence from
          a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael DeBruyn and bringing back
          stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody
          Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Willow Shields, Paula Malcomson, Donald
          Sutherland, Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz along with new cast
          members Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone and Jeffrey
          Wright. It was the highest-grossing domestic box office release of
          2013 and the 10th highest-grossing domestic release of all time.
          Lionsgate will release THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART 1 on
          November 21, 2014 and THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART 2 on
          November 20, 2015, also directed by Lawrence. All four films are being
          produced by Nina Jacobson of Color Force and Jon Kilik.

          In September 2013, Suzanne released a critically acclaimed
          autobiographical picture book, YEAR OF THE JUNGLE, illustrated by
          James Proimos. It deals with the year she was six and her father was
          deployed to Viet Nam. It has been sold into 12 territories in 11
          languages. Her first picture book, WHEN CHARLIE MCBUTTON LOST POWER,
          about a boy obsessed with computer games, was illustrated by Mike
          Lester and came out in 2005. It has been sold into 4 foreign
          territories. Her books have sold over 100 million copies worldwi

              Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she
              cannot stop. And what scares her more is that she's not entirely
              convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta
              to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the
              stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow
              of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the
              consequences will be horrifying.(Scholastic Press, 2009)

              be North America. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol
              and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district
              agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual
              televised event called, "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules,
              and level of audience participation may change but one thing is

        <h1>Interview</h1>
        <img src="images/suzanne-rat.jpg" />
        <p>
          Here is an interview that I did with Jen Rees at Scholastic Press:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Of all the places Gregor could have traveled to, why the Underland?
          <br />
          <br />
          I liked the fact that this world was teeming under New York City and
          nobody was aware of it. That you could be going along preoccupied with
          your own problems and then whoosh! You take a wrong turn in your
          laundry room and suddenly a giant cockroach is right in your face. No
          magic, no space or time travel, there's just a ticket to another world
          behind your clothes dryer.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Is there anything you find/found difficult or challenging in
          writing from the perspective of an 11-year-old boy? I remember being
          eleven very clearly and I had a lot of friends who were boys so it
          felt pretty natural being in Gregor's head.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Are you anything like Gregor?
          <br />
          <br />
          I think I'm like Gregor because we both want to do the right thing but
          sometimes have trouble figuring out what it is. Also, neither of us
          likes to ride roller coasters and we've both changed a lot of diapers.
          But Gregor is much braver than I am…if I even see a regular sized rat
          in New York City I immediately cross the street.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. What kinds of things did you enjoy doing when you were 11?
          <br />
          <br />
          Gymnastics, like Luxa. Reading. Running around in the woods with my
          friends.
          <br />
          <br />
          5. Many people think bats, rats, cockroaches, and spiders are creepy!
          Did you have to get over your fear of any (or all!) of them to write
          this story?
          <br />
          <br />
          I wish I could say that after I researched the creepy animals I was no
          longer at all afraid of them…but that would be a big fib! Cockroaches
          aren't really scary, just a little germy, so I don't mind them much. I
          love bats…except these really loud ones that get in my attic in the
          summer and hold some kind of party all night long. Spiders still scare
          me some, although I'm also fascinated by them and I can happily watch
          them from a distance. But rats…not pet rats but the wild kind…I will
          always have what I consider to be a healthy fear of rats. You should,
          too.
          <br />
          <br />
          6. Are you kinder to cockroaches, bats, rats, and/or spiders nowadays?
          <br />
          <br />
          I don't think I was ever particularly unkind to them…but I do have
          more of a connection with them now. I'm more aware of their
          similarities to humans. And I'm sympathetic to their desire to
          survive, which all creatures share.
          <br />
          <br />
          7. Did you have a sibling who, like Boots, got you into a world of
          trouble?
          <br />
          <br />
          I have two older sisters and one older brother and hold them largely
          responsible for the trouble I got into growing up. I believe as the
          youngest child, that is my right.
          <br />
          <br />
          8. Have you ever lived in New York City?
          <br />
          <br />
          I lived in New York City for 16 years, from 1987 to 2003. But when I
          was growing up we moved all the time because my dad was in the Air
          Force. We were mostly on the eastern half of the U.S. and in Europe
          but, like Gregor, I definitely know what it feels like to be a
          stranger somewhere.
          <br />
          <br />
          9. If you had to go to the Underland, what items would you take along
          with you? And who would you take with you?
          <br />
          <br />
          I'd take all the flashlights and batteries I could find. I'd also take
          a couple of bottles of water and chocolate, because I don't like
          traveling without either of these things. I would wear very
          comfortable clothes and sneakers…in case I had to run. My husband,
          Cap, would be great to have in the Underland, since he is very good in
          an emergency, but I'd want him to be with our kids up in the Overland
          so I'd know they were in safe hands. (Note: Cap says he would not take
          me to the Underland because I am not good in an emergency and I would
          constantly make him stop and ask for directions. Both of these things
          are true.) So I think I would take my good friend Christopher Santos
          with me, because he is very diplomatic and travels a lot and he seems
          at ease in foreign places. Also, he would never make loud, mean
          remarks about the creatures which could get a person in all kinds of
          trouble. In the Underland, I would make it my first order of business
          to hook up with a couple of bats because, let's face it, without a bat
          you're probably going to end up as someone's lunch.
          <br />
          <br />
          10. Have you ever been lost and wanted to find your way home?
          <br />
          <br />
          All the time. I have a terrible sense of direction. I get lost
          practically every time I leave my house. Fortunately, people are
          usually very kind about giving you directions if you ask politely.
          <br />

          11. Do you think you were destined to be a writer? (or is there some
          free will involved?!)
          <br />
          <br />
          I…have no idea how to answer this. I would have to go to a cave and
          meditate on it or something, and then I probably still wouldn't know.

          12. If you could invite one of the characters to have dinner with your
          family, who would it be? What might you cook for them?! What questions
          would you ask them?
          <br />
          <br />
          I would invite Ripred to dinner because I think he would tell the most
          interesting stories. We would have to serve shrimp in cream sauce
          because this is his favorite dish of all. Just to irritate him, I
          would tell him he has to use a napkin—or he won't get dessert. He
          would use the napkin, because dessert would be a fabulous chocolate
          cake and he loves food, but I bet he would glare at me the whole time.
          I would ask all kinds of questions about being a rat, and living alone
          in the Dead Land, and about his family. Ripred sometimes sneaks up to
          the Overland, so I would ask him his opinion of New York City, too.
          After dinner, we'd play Scrabble.

          13. All fun aside for a moment, Gregor is also about war and battling
          forces and survival. Can you tell us a little bit about this?"
          <br />
          <br />
          Gregor falls into a fantastical world, but he's really acting out the
          main role in a war story. Almost as soon as he arrives in the
          Underland, he's recognized as the "warrior" of the prophecies and he's
          called upon to undertake what are essentially a series of military
          missions. For instance, in Book I he goes into enemy territory to
          rescue a prisoner of war who also happens to be his dad. It's never
          described as such, but that's what's really happening.
          <br />
          <br />
          As the series continues, Gregor is faced with increasingly difficult
          quests and choices as the Underland breaks into a massive global war.
          His struggle to survive-both physically and spiritually-forms the arc
          of The Underland Chronicles.
